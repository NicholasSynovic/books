# Books

> A repository to track books that I have found interesting, relevant, and
> important to my well being, my life, and my career

## About

This page is meant to simply catalog and share books that I have read that I
have found to be influential in how I conduct myself, my relationships, my
finances, my career, or other future aspects. I want to use this page to
document these works in order to properly share them with the others.

## How to Contribute

While this is a personal list, and is not meant to be frequently updated, I
would appreciate viewers of this list to file
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NicholasSynovic/books/issues) whenever links
to the books that I reccomend become out of date. I do not intend to update
books to point to the latest version of the book - as I most likely have not
read the latest version - but I would appreciate updated URLs to where these
books can be found or purchased.

To submit a new URL, you can visit
[this link](https://github.com/NicholasSynovic/books/issues/new?assignees=&labels=updated-url&projects=&template=update-book-url.md&title=Update+Book+URL)
to start filling out a pre-made template. Thanks!

## How to Use This List

Assume this list is entirely based on personal opinion. I am not a critic, nor
someone that thinks I have a pristine taste for books and therefore you should
agree to my opinion. You should take my list as suggestions or a starting point
to then begin your own educational journey.

Books marked with a star emoji (⭐) are my top books for that bookshelf. Else,
books are not organized in any meaningful order.

Books can be a part of multiple collections.

Where ever possible, I have put Amazon URLs to books not in the public domain,
and Project Gutenberg links to those that are, and the relevant webpages if the
book is freely availible to download.

This list **does not** include every book that I have read. Please see my
[Goodreads read bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/121365011-nicholas-synovic?shelf=read)
for that list.

Bookshelves on this list do not align with my Goodreads bookshelf and most
likely never will.

Books without URLs are books that I've quickly added to this list and are in the
process of being updated with the relevant information.
